      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>
        Lomo saltado is a Peruvian dish of marinated beef stir-fried with
        onions, tomatoes, and other ingredients, and typically served with rice
        and french fries. It originated in the chifa tradition, which is Chinese
        cuisine in Peru.

      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen French fries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound beef tri tip, sliced 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced into strips</li>
        <li>3 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and sliced into strips</li>
        <li>1 yellow chili pepper (preferably Peruvian aji amarillo)</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 dash soy sauce to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Steps:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li title="Step 1">
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li title="Step 2">
          Arrange frozen French fries in a single layer on an ungreased cookie
          sheet.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 3">
          Bake in the preheated oven until light golden, 22 to 24 minutes.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 4">
          Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan over medium-high
          heat. Season sliced beef with salt and pepper. Cook and stir beef in
          hot oil until just cooked and the juices release. Use a slotted spoon
          to transfer beef to a plate.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 5">
          Cook and stir onions in beef drippings in the pan until translucent, 3
          to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato and aji amarillo; cook until tomato
          softens. Pour in vinegar and soy sauce.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 6">
          Add French fries and beef to the pan. Cover and cook until beef is
          cooked through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle
          with chopped parsley to serve.
        </li>
