        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>1 pound lamb chops</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground red pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>7 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon saffron</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons warm milk</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Steps:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li title="Step 1">
          Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several
          inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 2">
          Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves,
          cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in the hot oil until fragrant,
          about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are
          lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger
          paste into the onion mixture; cook until the garlic and ginger is
          fragrant, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the
          mixture and cook 1 minute more.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 3">
          Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the
          lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 4">
          Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the
          mixture; continue cooking until the oil begins to separate from the
          gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and
          cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed
          to keep the mixture from getting too dry.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 5">
          Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a
          saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15
          minutes; drain any excess water.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 6">
          Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the
          hot oil until lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li title="Step 7">
          Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid.
          Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried onion over the
          lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm
          milk together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover
          the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the
          rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.
